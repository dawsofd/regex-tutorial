# Regex Tutorial (UCB-VIRT-FSF-PT-07-2024-U-LOLC Homework Assignment #17)

Hello! This is a tutorial explaining how a specific regular expression (regex) functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

The regular expression covered in this tutorial will be "Matching an Email":

```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/```

Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a string of text matches the expected pattern of an email address (i.e. an unspecified number of characters preceding the @ symbol, followed by a domain.  The specific components of the expression are broken out and defined below.   

## Table of Contents
Components included in the matching an email expression: 
- [Anchors](#anchors)
- [Quantifiers](#quantifiers)
- [Character Classes](#character-classes)
- [Grouping and Capturing](#grouping-and-capturing)
- [Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions)

Other common components:
- [OR Operator](#or-operator)
- [Greedy and Lazy Match](#greedy-and-lazy-match)
- [Flags](#flags)
- [Boundaries](#boundaries)
- [Back-references](#back-references)
- [Look-ahead and Look-behind](#look-ahead-and-look-behind)
